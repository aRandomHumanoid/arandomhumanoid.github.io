While the website is still in development, in particular the portfolio posts, I've put up a few images of projects that I've gathered in a library as a way to give a cursory look at some of what I've done (see tabs on the top right). Again, if you want to see more about these projects, including the CAD, check the [Github](https://github.com/aRandomHumanoid/CAD/tree/main/Projects). Enjoy!
